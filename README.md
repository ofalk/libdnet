libdnet
-------

This is a fork of the original libdnet (https://github.com/dugsong/libdnet), since the
previous author doesn't respon to issues and pull requests.
We're currently trying to get this in shape (again), address the issues and pull requests,
available in the original Github repo and eventually will rename this repo (opinions?).

libdnet provides a simplified, portable interface to several low-level
networking routines, including network address manipulation, kernel
arp(4) cache and route(4) table lookup and manipulation, network
firewalling, network interface lookup and manipulation, IP tunnelling,
and raw IP packet and Ethernet frame transmission.
